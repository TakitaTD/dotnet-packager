# dotnet-packager

Easy way to package, and build dotnet projects for a lot of operating systems.

## Why did I make this in JavaScript?

Because I can't be fucked to make it in a different programming language.
Imagine if I made this in rust lol
BLAZINGLY FAST ðŸš€ #MADEWITHRUST TYPE-SAFE BLAZING FAST

## NOTES

I only tested ./dotnet_packager in Linux, so, if you want to use this on Windows, it should be pretty self-explanatory:
`node ./main.js --{command}`

## Dependencies

- node.js (obviously)
- dotnet (obviously)
- an operating system
- a computer
- a shell
