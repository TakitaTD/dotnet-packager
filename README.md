# dotnet-packager

Easy way to package, and build dotnet projects for a lot of operating systems.

## Why did I make this in JavaScript?

Because I can't be fucked to make it in a different programming language.

## NOTES

I only tested ./dotnet_packager in Linux, so, if you want to use this on Windows, it should be pretty self-explanatory:
node ./main.js --{command}
